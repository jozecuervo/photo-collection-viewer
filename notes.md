As Julie mentioned during your conversation, the next step in the application process will be for you to perform a technical exercise.

## Questions 1 -
- Should I only be concerned with displaying a single album or should this project include a view to select from multiple albums?
   - Should I hard code the project to a single album?
- Is authentication a part of the exercise? Should I assume a hard-coded api key for google / flickr?
- Will I be expected to update history or implement a router?
- You mentioned CSS preprocessors. Are candidates encouraged to use a build tool to minify / validate source as part of this project?
- Are unit tests expected? Nice to have?
- Finally - I was thinking of using some professional photos from a relative and going with a modern "artist portfolio" look and feel. Does that sound appropriate?

### Answers -
1. I would not be concerned with multiple albums. A single album would be fine.
2. Auth isn't part of the exercise. You can hardcode something and assume you're building it as your own public page for display.
3. No, there is zero expectation to do this... if you have time and would like to... go for it.
4. This is your best chance to showcase your technical proficiency and best practices. Feel free to use the CSS preprocessor you are most comfortable. We use LESS but we can read SASS or Stylus just the same.
5. Thanks for asking this. Again, this is our best way to judge your technical skills so I would put your best foot forward in regards to tests.
6. That sounds ðŸ‘Œ
